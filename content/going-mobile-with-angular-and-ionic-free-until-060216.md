With [Angular](https://angularjs.org/) and [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/) building mobile apps is easier than ever. Ionic offers a solid, mature, cross-platform solution for using your favorite web tools to build native applications. This means sharing code between your web application and native application is an obvious and straight forward process.
